                  <h3>Your Guide</h3>
                  <p>Even though I have only a "mere" 8 years to my name living in California, I would consider myself a proud local resident by now and know my way around L.A. pretty well.
                  I have been to all the major tourist sites and even the offbeat paths many don't travel or are aware of.
